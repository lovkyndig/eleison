# Eleison
The Theme in Eleison is [`BlogiNote`](https://github.com/Benbinbin/bloginote) (version 3.1.1) from [`Benbinbin`](https://github.com/Benbinbin), that is a hidden treasure, like the treasure in the Bible, hidden for the wise and prudent. Matt 11, 25. With my repo you can move on to `Google Play Store`, and get better Page Load Analyze.

## Install and setup
Read the release notes for guide to setup a release.
NB! _Typescript > 4.9.5_ stop _vue-tsc_ from checking typescript errors on `dev`.

- Add find()-function and
- Change Search-box

# Eleison
The Theme in Eleison is [`BlogiNote`](https://github.com/Benbinbin/bloginote){:target="_blank"} (version 3.1.1) from [`Benbinbin`](https://github.com/Benbinbin){:target="_blank"}, that is a hidden treasure, like the treasure in the Bible, hidden for the wise and prudent. Matt 11, 25. With my repo you can move on to `Google Play Store`, and get better Page Load Analyze.

## Install and setup
Read the release notes for guide to setup a release.
NB! _Typescript > 4.9.5_ stop _vue-tsc_ from checking typescript errors on `dev`.

## To do-list (personal notes)
- Move bubblewrap build from root to antoher folder.
- Fix the find-function - who shows the first place in the modal-window, but skips the first place in the article if more than one hit.
- Change Search-box
  - Use PageFind only on frontpage or in list
  - Use window.find() on /pages/article/[...slug].vue
- Add dark-light-themetoggle

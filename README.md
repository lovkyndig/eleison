# Eleison
The Theme in Eleison is [`BlogiNote`](https://github.com/Benbinbin/bloginote) (version 3.1.1) from [`Benbinbin`](https://github.com/Benbinbin), that is a hidden treasure, like the treasure in the Bible, hidden for the wise and prudent. [Matt 11, 25](https://no.bibelsite.com/matthew/11-25.htm). With my repo you can move on to [`Google Play Store`](https://play.google.com/console).

## Install and setup
Read the release notes for guide to setup a release.
NB! 
* _Typescript > 4.9.5_ stop _vue-tsc_ from checking typescript errors on `dev`.
* _mermaid_ > 10.0.0 not working on promise-based mermaid.

## To do-list (personal notes)
- Add dark-light-theme-toggle
- Add find()-function (to continue searching if more than one find on the same page)
